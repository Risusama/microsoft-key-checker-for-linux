# Microsoft Key Checker for Linux
Source code repository

This is an attempt to port ONLY the Key Check functionality of "Microsoft Toolkit" to Linux.
It would be intended for scenarios, where a Windows user has a key, but does not remember which edition it activates.

THIS TOOL DOES NOT NOW AND NEVER WILL ACTIVATE WINDOWS COPIES, WHETHER IT BE A LEGAL OR AN ILLEGAL KEY.
